        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Indian Railways being the lifeline of the country, are the most chosen mode of transport by
            the people across the country. Since railway transport is cost- effective and comfortable it is
            more preferred by the people. So, if this management system is made online with the
            integration of new technology, it will benefit the people and will help them save their time
            rather than standing in queues for booking the ticket.</p>
